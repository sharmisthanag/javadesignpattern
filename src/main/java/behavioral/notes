chain of responsibility pattern is a behavioral pattern that
decouples a request from a handling object in a chain of handlers until it is finally recognized
decoupling of sender and receiver.receiver contains reference to next receiver.this promotes loose coupling.
eg: java.util.Logging.log(),filter,securityChain filter in Spring
Design:Chain of receiver object,handler is interface based,concrete handler for implementation,each handler has reference
to the next

command pattern encapsulates each request as object.object oriented callback.sender decoupled from processor.
add undo functionality .example: implementation java.lang.Runnable.object per command.command interface.execute method.
unexecute method optional.use reflection.Command,Invoker,concrete command,receiver.object per command.class contains 'what'
encapsulate action.

Interpreter represents grammar.music notation,mathematical notation.used parse source code.
example: java.util.Pattern, java.text.Format.
Design:Abstract Expression,Interpret,Terminal Expression,NonTerminal Expression,Context,Client

visitor pattern : choose when to separate algorithm from object.open close principle.e.g: java.lang.model.elementVisitor.Visitor
class contains the changes and specialization rather than changing the original object.
design: interface based.elements,
