chain of responsibility pattern is a behavioral pattern that
decouples a request from a handling object in a chain of handlers until it is finally recognized
decoupling of sender and receiver.receiver contains reference to next receiver.this promotes loose coupling.
eg: java.util.Logging.log(),filter,securityChain filter in Spring
Design:Chain of reciever object,handler is interface based,concrete handler for implementation,each handler has reference
to the next
